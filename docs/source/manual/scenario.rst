Setting up a scenario
------------

A scenario file is a simple toml-structured text file that defines which models you want to run, for which hindcast or forecast period, and with which data sources.

Below, two examples of scenario files are given. The first is a determininistic simulation of hurricane Laura, the second an ensemble run for hurricane Maria.

.. include:: examples/scenario.toml
       :literal: 

.. include:: examples/scenario2.toml
       :literal: 

The scenario file must always be named *scenario.toml*. CoSMoS assigns the scenario *name* based on the folder name 
(see also :ref:`Folder structure <folder_structure>`).

The following settings can be included in the scenario file:
