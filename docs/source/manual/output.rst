CoSMoS output

Scenario output
^^^^^^^^^^^^

After running a CoSMoS scenario, the output is stored in the *scenarios* folder. For each new cycle time, a new cycle folder is created. 
An example of an output folder structure is shown below for a scenario called *hurricane_irma* with a cycle that starts on 4 September 2017.

In the *job_list* folder, you can find an overview of completed models. 
When rerunning a scenario, any models that are marked as finished in the *job_list* folder will not be executed again. 
To rerun specific models or the entire selection for a particular scenario, it is necessary to delete these *finished* files.

The *models* folder contains all model input and output.
The *restart* folder contains restart files for all models.

.. _webviewer:

Webviewer
^^^^^^^^^^^^

CoSMoS output is presented in a webviewer which provides an interactive method of viewing the results for the different scenarios and model output. 
The webviewer can be found under *webviewers/webviewer_name* and is structured as listed below. All model results are automatically transferred to the webviewer folder.
The only thing you need to do is open the webviewer file (*index.html*)!
